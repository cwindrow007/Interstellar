# NovaBot

InsterStellar is a Discord Bot in development for the Interstellar Games discord. This bot will have many features with planned implementation via JavaScript, running locally on a Raspberry Pi. This code will/can be forked in a way to enable someone else to program their own discord bot with ease within discord or within their own JavaScript editor if needed. The goal is to allow any user(regardless of programming skill or not) the ability to have their own independednt discord server bot which allows ease to avoid "too many" discord bots in a user-friendly easy to manage environment. Updates are shipped bi-weekly to monthly depending on work load.
